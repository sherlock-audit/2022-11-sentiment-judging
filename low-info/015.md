# `assetsLen` is not capped, `sweepTo()` may not have enough gas

## Summary
`assetsLen` is not capped, `sweepTo()` may not have enough gas
## Vulnerability Detail
`assetsLen` has no upper limit. Users can keep adding tokens through `addAsset()`. In `sweepTo()`, the `assetsLen` array is traversed and a transfer operation is initiated for each `asset`, which uses a lot of gas and leads to insufficient gas

```solidity
    function sweepTo(address toAddress) external accountManagerOnly {
        uint assetsLen = assets.length;
        for(uint i; i < assetsLen; ++i) {
            try IERC20(assets[i]).transfer(
                toAddress, assets[i].balanceOf(address(this))
            ) {} catch {}
            if (assets[i].balanceOf(address(this)) == 0)
                hasAsset[assets[i]] = false;
        }
        delete assets;
        toAddress.safeTransferEth(address(this).balance);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Limit the length of assetslen
2. Record the failed indexes
