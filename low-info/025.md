# `safeApprove` is front-runnable

## Summary
`safeApproe` is front-runnable

## Vulnerability Detail
``` solidity
/**
 * @dev Deprecated. This function has issues similar to the ones found in
 * {IERC20-approve}, and its usage is discouraged.
 *
 * Whenever possible, use {safeIncreaseAllowance} and
 * {safeDecreaseAllowance} instead.
 */
```
Ref: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L39-L45

``` solidity
// safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
// or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
// 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
```
Ref: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L51-L53

By the [`SafeERC20.sol`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) of OpenZeppelin, `safeApprove()` is deprecated due to it has the vulnerability.

This attack pattern is as follows.

### Example
- Eve has 100 allowances from `AccountManager`.

Now the `AccountManager` decide to change the approval of Eve from 100 to 50. 

Eve detects the transaction the `safeApprove(address(Eve),50)` from `AccountManager`

And Eve execute this function before the approve transaction mined.
``` solidity
transferFrom(address(AccuntManger),address(Eve), 100);
```

Then withdraw 50 with the newly set approval. 
As a result, Eve could transfer 150.

## Impact
An attacker may withdraw more than intended as AccountManager expected.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-sentiment/blob/main/protocol-merged/src/core/AccountManager.sol#L264-L277
``` solidity
    function approve(
        address account,
        address token,
        address spender,
        uint amt
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyOwner(account)
    {
        if(address(controller.controllerFor(spender)) == address(0))
            revert Errors.FunctionCallRestricted();
        account.safeApprove(token, spender, amt);
    }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-sentiment/blob/main/protocol-merged/src/utils/Helpers.sol#L56-L60
``` solidity
function safeApprove(address account, address token, address spender, uint amt) internal {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = IAccount(account).exec(token, 0,
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.approve.selector, spender, amt));
        require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), "APPROVE_FAILED");
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use [`safeIncreaseAllowance`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L61-L68) and [`safeDecreaseAllowance`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L70-L81) instead of setting the arbitrary amount.
