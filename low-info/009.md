# Use Try /Catch for fetching prices using Chainlink

## Summary
Chainlink can block Prices at will
## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink’s multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will. Therefore, to prevent denial of service scenarios, it is recommended to query Chainlink price feeds using a defensive approach with Solidity’s try/catch structure. In this way, if the call to the price feed fails, the caller contract is still in control and can handle any errors safely and explicitly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Surround the call to `latestRoundData()` with `try/catch` instead of calling it directly. In a scenario where the call reverts, the catch block can be used to call a `fallback oracle `or handle the error in any other suitable way.
