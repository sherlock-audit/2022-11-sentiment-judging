# 1 day (86400 seconds) might be too much for a stale price check

## Summary
A price that is 23 hours old will still work with the current code, which could have devastating results for the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
Throughout the code (ChainlinkOracle.sol & WSTETHOracle.sol) there are checks that price answer was updated <24 hours ago. This can become a problem in the scenario that a token price falls very quickly but Chainlink's price feeds are stopped or non-working. It happened this year with UST, when Chainlink paused it's oracle for it on around $0.20 but the price was much lower, resulting in losses in the millions of dollars for some DeFi protocols.

Right now, if the price has not been updated in 23 hours and 30 minutes the code will still work, even though it is possible that it has crashed close to zero.
## Impact
Using stale data can result in undercollateralised positions or mistakenly liquidated ones, both causing a loss to either the protocol or the users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the stale price check to be for price answer not older than 10 minutes or implement pausing functionality on the oracle.
