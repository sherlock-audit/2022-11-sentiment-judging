# Curve LP staking allows adding false tokensIn to account by setting _claim_rewards to false

## Summary

In CurveLPStakingController.sol and BalancerLPStakingController.sol, `canDepositAndClaim()` and `canWithdrawAndClaim()` assume that the user is claiming reward tokens, and add these tokens to the `tokensIn` array (to add to their account). 

However, the only requirement to go down this code path is to use the full function signature (ie `deposit(uint256,address,bool)`), so false tokens will be added to a user account if they use the full signature with the `_claim_rewards` bool set to `false`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Each Controller returns an array of `tokensIn` that will be added to the user's account, if they don't already hold a balance.

In CurveLPStakingController.sol and BalancerLPStakingController.sol, there are two overlapping pairs of function signatures: 
- `deposit(uint256)` and `deposit(uint256,address,bool)` are the same function, but the middle parameter (`_addr`) defaults to `msg.sender` and the final parameter (`_claim_rewards`) defaults to `false`
- `withdraw(uint256)` and `withdraw(uint256,bool)` are the same function, but the final parameter (`_claim_rewards`) defaults to `false`

The assumption in the Controller logic is that, if a user uses the full signature, they are claiming their rewards. However, this isn't always the case. It is perfectly valid for a user to use the full function and pass `false` (the default argument) to the `_claim_rewards` parameter.

In this case, the function signature would lead to `canDepositAndClaim()` or `canWithdrawAndClaim()`, and all the rewards tokens would be added to the user's account.

## Impact

Accounting on user accounts can be thrown off (intentionally or unintentionally), resulting in mismatches between their assets array and hasAsset mapping and the reality of their account.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In `canCall()`, decode the calldata to get the value of the `_claim_rewards` bool. If this value is false, call the non-claim version of the function (ie `canDeposit()` instead of `canDepositAndClaim()`).
