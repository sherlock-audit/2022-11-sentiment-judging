# `WSTETHOracle` needs to check for sequencer availability

## Summary
Using Chainlink's Arbitrum price feeds you should always check for sequencer availability

## Vulnerability Detail
The wsETH-stETH oracle is only available on Arbitrum. As per Chainlink's [documentation](https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds/), since Arbitrum is an L2 solution, the price feed is loaded by a sequencer. To stay secure, you should always check for sequencer availability, otherwise the data you are using might be stale.

## Impact
If sequencer has not been available and the price is not the real one, this can result in undercollateralised positions or mistakenly liquidated ones, both causing a loss to either the protocol or the users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the same function that you have in `ArbiChainlinkOracle.sol` to `WSTETHOracle.sol`
`    function isSequencerActive() internal view returns (bool) {
        (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt,,) = sequencer.latestRoundData();
        if (block.timestamp - startedAt <= GRACE_PERIOD_TIME || answer == 1)
            return false;
        return true;
    }`
And also add the following check on the first line of `getPrice()`:
`if (!isSequencerActive()) revert Errors.L2SequencerUnavailable();`
