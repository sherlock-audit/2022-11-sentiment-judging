# Sentiment Balancer Weighted Pool Oracles Are Manipulable

## Summary
Balancer balances can be flash manipulated. An attacker can execute a transaction on Balancer to manipulate or change the pool's balances. Sentiment's Balancer weighted pool price oracles rely on balancer pool balances. Therefore an attacker can manipulate/change pool balances to manipulate Sentiment's Balancer weighted pool price oracles. The getPrice function for the WeightedBalancerLPOracle is not flash loan resistant as it relies on pool balances. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Sentiment WeightedBalancerLPOracle getPrice function relies on Balancer pool balances to calculate the oracle price. These balances are manipulable as an attacker can execute a large trade to update them. This enables an attacker to manipulate the Sentiment oracle price for Balancer weighted pools. The getPrice function uses the Balancer Pool's balances to calculate the invariant. The invariant is then used to calculate the price oracle. An attacker can manipulate the pool's balances by trading or flash trading on Balancer.

Therefore it is possible for an attacker to manipulate sentiment's weighted balancer pool price oracles.

## Impact
Oracle price manipulation can lead to large losses for borrowers and for the protocol. The attacker could manipulate the Balancer oracle price to force borrowers into liquidation or borrow at an inflated value. This can lead to bad debts and losses for the protocol and lenders.
