# Problematic implementation of safeTransferFrom() and safeTransfer()

## Summary
The implementation of safeTransferFrom() and safeTransfer() in Helpers.sol expects that the transferFrom() and transfer() functions in the underlying ERC20 token returns a boolean value whether the transfer was successfull, however some ERC20 tokens (such as USDT on ethereum mainnet and BNB's transfer() method) do not conform to this standard and do not return a boolean value whatsoever. This issue could lead to the protocol being unable to implement such ERC20 tokens that stray away from the standard or could lead to other unexpected behavior of the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
In Helpers.sol on line-20 and line-32 there are require statements that expect that the transfer operation called earlier returns a boolean value, as already mentioned, some ERC20 tokens do not conform to that and do not return a boolean value or have other behavior.
## Impact
Some tokens won't be able to be used by the protocol or other unexpected behavior might occur.
## Code Snippet
safeTransferFrom() in Helpers.sol - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-sentiment/blob/main/protocol-merged/src/utils/Helpers.sol#L10-L21
safeTransfer() in Helpers.sol - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-sentiment/blob/main/protocol-merged/src/utils/Helpers.sol#L23-L33
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
The OpenZeppelin implementation of safeTransferFrom() and safeTransfer() can be used - it uses a _callOptionalReturn() function that prevents unexpected behaviour from ERC20 tokens that do not confom strictly to the standard.
