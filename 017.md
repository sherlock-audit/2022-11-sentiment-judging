# Even if the address doesn’t exist, the low level call returns true

## Summary
If the address doesn’t exist, the low-level call will return true.
This leads to an unexpected error.

## Vulnerability Detail
As written in the [solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions), the low-level functions call, delegatecall and statically return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-sentiment/blob/main/protocol-merged/src/core/Account.sol#L150-L157
``` solidity
function exec(address target, uint amt, bytes calldata data)
        external
        accountManagerOnly
        returns (bool, bytes memory)
    {
        (bool success, bytes memory retData) = target.call{value: amt}(data);
        return (success, retData);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Check for the account’s existence prior to transferring.
``` solidity
function exec(address target, uint amt, bytes calldata data)
        external
        accountManagerOnly
        returns (bool, bytes memory)
    {
        require(!isContract(to),"NOT EXIST");
        (bool success, bytes memory retData) = target.call{value: amt}(data);
        return (success, retData);
    }
```
