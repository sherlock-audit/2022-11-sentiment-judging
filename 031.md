# Oracle may return a stale price since the tolerance time is too long (86400 seconds = 1 day) and round ID is not used in the check.

## Summary
Oracle may return a stale price since the tolerance time is too long (86400 seconds = 1 day) and round ID is not used in the check.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function getSTETHPrice() internal view returns (uint) { 
     (, int answer,, uint updatedAt,) = 
         STETHFeed.latestRoundData(); 
  
     if (block.timestamp - updatedAt >= 86400) 
         revert Errors.StalePrice(address(0), address(WSTETHFeed)); 
  
     if (answer <= 0) 
         revert Errors.NegativePrice(address(0), address(WSTETHFeed)); 
  
     return ( 
         (uint(answer)*1e18)/getEthPrice() 
     ); 
 } 
```

Stale price check is too risky:
1. 86400 seconds = 1 day is too long for a major de-pegging event
2. round ID is not checked

## Impact
getSTETHPrice and getEthPrice may return a stale price. stETH de-pegging usually happens only in a short amount of time in a matter of minutes. Oracle is required to be able to update immediately otherwise. If oracle is not updated in 1 hour, it should be considered stale but the code can tolerate the stale price for up to 1 day. This creates a huge opportunity for an attacker to arbitrage the price different.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add round ID check and reduce stale price tolerance period to shorter time such as 1 hour

```solidity
 function getSTETHPrice() internal view returns (uint) { 
     (uint80 baseRoundID, int256 answer, /* */, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 baseAnsweredInRound) =
         STETHFeed.latestRoundData(); 

     if (baseAnsweredInRound < baseRoundID)
         revert Errors.StalePrice(address(0), address(WSTETHFeed)); 
  
     if (block.timestamp - updatedAt >= 3600) 
         revert Errors.StalePrice(address(0), address(WSTETHFeed)); 
  
     if (answer <= 0) 
         revert Errors.NegativePrice(address(0), address(WSTETHFeed)); 
  
     return ( 
         (uint(answer)*1e18)/getEthPrice() 
     ); 
 } 
```
