# Curve deposit function fails if user passes address but no bool

## Summary

The `deposit()` function on the Curve staking contract (used in CurveLPStakingController.sol and BalancerLPStakingController.sol) has two optional parameters: `_addr` and `_claim_rewards`.

The controller allows for neither of these parameters to be passed, or for both to be passed, but does not include the signature for when just one of the arguments is passed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Vyper contract for Curve LP staking has a deposit function with the following signature:

```vyper
def deposit(_value: uint256, _addr: address = msg.sender, _claim_rewards: bool = False):
```
This function has a required `_value` argument, and optional `_addr` and `_claim_rewards` arguments.

To pass an optional argument in Vyper, we must pass all the earlier optional arguments. In other words, we are not able to call `deposit(uint256,bool)` because we can't pass the bool without the address.

However, we are allowed to pass earlier optional arguments and ignore later ones. Therefore, `deposit(uint256,address)` is a valid function signature that a user could call to specify the address for the deposit without claiming rewards.

This function has a function signature of `0x6e553f65` and should be included in the whitelisted functions in the Controller.

## Impact

Users are limited in the actions they can take due to an oversight in function signatures.

## Recommendation

Include the `0x6e553f65`  function signature in both the CurveLPStakingController.sol and BalancerLPStakingController.sol contracts.
