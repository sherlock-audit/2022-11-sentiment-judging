# Curve LP Controller withdraw and claim function uses wrong signature

## Summary

The function signature used for `WITHDRAWCLAIM` in both CurveLPStakingController.sol and BalancerLPStakingController.sol are incorrect, leading to the function not succeeding.

## Vulnerability Detail

In both the CurveLPStakingController.sol and BalancerLPStakingController.sol contracts, the function selector `0x00ebf5dd` is used for `WITHDRAWCLAIM`. This selector corresponds to a function signature of `withdraw(uint256,address,bool)`.

```solidity
bytes4 constant WITHDRAWCLAIM = 0x00ebf5dd;
```

However, the `withdraw()` function in the Curve contract does not have an address argument. Instead, the function signature reads `withdraw(uint256,bool)`, which corresponds to a function selector of `0x38d07436`.

## Impact

Users who have deposited assets into Curve pools will not be able to claim their rewards when they withdraw their tokens.

## Recommendation

Change the function selector in both contracts to `0x38d07436`.
