# Curve LP staking allows adding false tokensIn by inputting another address

## Summary

In CurveLPStakingController.sol and BalancerLPStakingController.sol, `canDepositAndClaim()` adds all reward tokens to the `tokensIn` array (to add to their account).

However, the `deposit()` function allows for an address to be inputted, which is used as both the owner of the staked tokens, and to claim the rewards. 

If a user inputs such an address, they will not receive reward tokens, but the protocol will incorrectly add these tokens to their account.

## Vulnerability Detail

Each Controller returns an array of `tokensIn` that will be added to the user's account, if they don't already hold a balance of that token.

In CurveLPStakingController.sol and BalancerLPStakingController.sol, the `canDepositAndClaim()` function is called when a user calls `deposit()` with the additional address and bool arguments.

However, if a user does pass an argument of `true` for `_claim_rewards`, they only actually receive the reward tokens if they pass their own address as `_addr`. If they pass another user's address, that user will receive the reward tokens.

## Impact

Accounting on user accounts can be thrown off (intentionally or unintentionally), resulting in mismatches between their assets array and hasAsset mapping and the reality of their account.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In `canCall()`, decode the calldata to get the value of the `_addr` address. If this value does not equal `msg.sender`, call the non-claim version of the function (ie `canDeposit()` instead of `canDepositAndClaim()`).
