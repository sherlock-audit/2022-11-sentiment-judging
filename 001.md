# Token price will not be computed

## Summary
For a token where poolTokens.length=1, `getPrice` will fail due to overflow error

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Let's say `getPrice` function is called for Token A
2. The number of pool tokens linked with token A is say 1 which is token A itself
3. Below loop runs

```solidity
for(uint i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            if (poolTokens[i] == token) continue;
            uint price = oracleFacade.getPrice(poolTokens[i]);
            minPrice = (price < minPrice) ? price : minPrice;
        }
```
4. Since there is only 1 token the loop run only once. Secondly since `poolTokens[i] == token` so `continue` is executed and in reality nothing is done in the loop
5. Finally price is calculated as below:

```solidity
return minPrice.mulWadDown(IPool(token).getRate());
```

6. Since `minPrice` is still `type(uint).max` so the multiplication in step 5 causes overflow

## Impact
Token price will not be computed and function will fail

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the token has `poolTokens.length=1` then price should be computed as

```solidity
return oracleFacade.getPrice(token);
```
